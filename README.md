# Final-DS-Capstone-Notebooks-
This is the repository for the final capstone project for the IBM Data Science Certificate Program in Coursera.

## Aim
Through this capstone project, we aim to predict if the Falcon 9 stage I project
will launch successfully or not, as a rival company to the popular SpaceX

## Various Steps in Project Methodology

i) Data Collection using API and Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup;

ii) Data Wrangling with Pandas;

iii) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with SQL and Matplotlib;

iv) Interactive Data Visualization with Folium and Plotly Dash;

v) Machine Learning for Classification using Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree, and k Nearest Neighbors ( kNN ), to predict the probability of a successful launch
